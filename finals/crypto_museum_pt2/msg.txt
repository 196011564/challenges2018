Somebody once told me the chall is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest cryptographer It was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on its plaintext Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the flags and I solve cryptos running Didn't make sense not to solve for fun Your brain gets smart but your thumbs get numb So much to try, so much to learn So what's wrong with taking the backdoors? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never solve if you don't grow Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is flags Only shooting stars break the challs It's a cool ctf and they say it gets colder You're all busy now, wait till you get older But the other teams beg to differ Judging by the hole in the algorithm used The key we use is getting pretty thin The cipher's getting solved so you might as well win My key's on fire, how about yours? That's the way I like it and I never get bored Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is flags Only shooting stars break the challs Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is flags Only shooting stars midnight{Somebody once asked could I spare some tips for chall} I need to get a solve on this crypto I said yep what a concept I could use a little flag myself And we could all use a little tip Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the flags and I solve cryptos running Didn't make sense not to solve for fun Your brain gets smart but your thumbs get numb So much to try, so much to learn So what's wrong with taking the backdoors? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never solve if you don't grow Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is flags Only shooting stars break the challs And all that glitters is flags Only shooting stars break the challs.
